## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (g++ or cl.exe)
- MinGW (for Windows) or GCC (for Linux/Mac)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

## Building and Running

### On Windows (with MinGW):
```bash
g++ -o output_file filename.cpp
./output_file
```

### Using VS Code:
1. Install C++ extension (ms-vscode.cpptools)
2. Configure compiler path for g++ or cl.exe
3. Use Ctrl+Shift+B to build
4. Run the generated executable

## File Organization

- Each day has its own folder: `DAY-01/`, `DAY-02/`, etc.
- C++ implementation files: `*.cpp`
- Related problem statements: `leetcode.txt`

## Learning Approach

This project follows a progressive approach:
1. **Fundamentals** (Days 1-3): Pattern printing, number systems, basic math
2. **Array Operations** (Days 4-7): Array manipulation, searching, exponentiation
3. **Pointers & Memory** (Days 10): Memory management and pointer operations
4. **Search Algorithms** (Days 12-16): Binary search and its applications
5. **Sorting** (Days 17-18): Classical sorting algorithms
6. **Data Structures** (Day 20): STL containers and usage
7. **String & Math** (Days 21-24): String operations, GCD, 2D arrays
8. **Recursion & Backtracking** (Days 28-34): Advanced problem-solving techniques
9. **Advanced Sorting** (Days 35-36): Merge sort and Quick sort

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to any `DAY-XX/` folder
3. Compile: `g++ -o program filename.cpp`
4. Run: `./program`

## Tips for Success

- ✓ Understand each algorithm before coding
- ✓ Experiment with different test cases
- ✓ Analyze time and space complexity
- ✓ Don't just copy—implement from scratch
- ✓ Practice regularly for skill mastery
- ✓ Refer to `leetcode.txt` for additional problems

## Build Configuration

The project includes build tasks for VS Code:
- **C/C++: g++.exe build active file**: Build with MinGW
- **C/C++: cl.exe build active file**: Build with MSVC
