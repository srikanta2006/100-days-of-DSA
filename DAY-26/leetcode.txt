Question number: 1
Title: Two sum
description: 
Given an array of numbers and a target number, find two numbers in the array which sum up to target

Intuition:
the brute force approach to solve this problem is to find all possible pairs using two loops. -> O(n^2)
the better approach is to sort the array and use two pointer approach. -> O(nlogn)
the best approach would be to use unordered_map as we can search an element using O(1) by using it.
Approach:
1)take an unordered_map<int,int> for element and its index according to the array
2)start a for loop
3)select first element and calculate required second=target-first.
4)search for second in map (m.find())
5)if found return else add the first element along with index into the map

Complexity:
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        vector<int> ans;
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int first = nums[i];
            int second = target - first;
            if(m.find(second)!=m.end()){
                ans.push_back(i);
                ans.push_back(m[second]);
                return ans;
            }
            else{
                m[first]=i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
