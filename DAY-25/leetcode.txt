Title: Search a 2D Matrix II
description: 
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
-Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
-Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Intuition:
This problem can be solved by traversing through each element of the matrix. That takes O(m*n) worst case time complexity.
This is not affordable. To optimize the solution we ca use binary search as the elements are in sorted order in a row and col.
Approach:
1)Start searching from row=0; and column=n-1;
2)
i If found return true;
ii if target is smaller -> col--;
iii if target is larger ->row++;
Complexity:
Time complexity:
O(m+n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int target) {
        int m=mat.size();
        int n=mat[0].size();
        int r=0;
        int c=n-1;
        while(c>=0 && r<=m-1){
            if(target==mat[r][c]){
                return true;
            }
            else if(target<mat[r][c]){
                c--;
            }
            else{
                r++;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
