Question number: 204
Title: count primes
description: Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Intuition:
running a loop over the n number and checking whether each of it is prime or not which is another loop is BF (TLE).
We need to use seive of Eratosthenes -> used to eliminate unwated numbers from checking and reduce the search space.
Approach:
1)create a vector with n+1 size and declare it true.
2)initially we consider all the numbers prime.
3)then run a loop over 2->n and eliminate all the multiples of numbers which are prime 
4)count the trues in the vector to give the count
Complexity:
Time complexity:
O(n log log n)

Space complexity:
O(n)

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        vector<bool> isPrime(n+1, true);
        int count=0;
        for(int i=2; i<n; i++){
            if(isPrime[i]){
                count++;
                for(int j=i*2; j<n; j=j+i){
                    isPrime[j]=false;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
