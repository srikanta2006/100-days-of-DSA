Title: sort colors
description: Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

Intuition:
By seeing there are only 3 unique elements in the array, we can just count the occurence of each element(0,1,2) using a loop, then using another loop we can rewrite the elements.
but this takes 2 individual loops, which can be still optimized using "DUTCH NATIONAL FLAG ALGORITHM"
Approach:
**Detailed explaination in 5-11-2025 notes DSA**
we take  4 spaces(0 space, 1space, 2 space and unsorted space )
by selecting each element from unsorted space we insert it into its space and decrease the unsorted region

Complexity:
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int low=0; 
        int mid=0;
        int high=n-1;
        while(mid<=high){
            if(nums[mid]==0){
                swap(nums[mid], nums[low]);
                mid++;
                low++;
            }
            else if(nums[mid]==1){
                mid++;
            }
            else{
                swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
